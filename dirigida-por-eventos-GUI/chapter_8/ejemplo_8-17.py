# Entry

'''
The Entry widget is a simple, single-line text input field. 
It is typically used for input
fields in form-like dialogs and anywhere else you need the user to type a value into a
field of a larger display. 
Entry also supports advanced concepts such as scrolling, key
bindings for editing, and text selections

from quitter import Quitter

def fetch():
    print('Input => "%s"' % ent.get())             # get text

    # .get() Returns the entry's current text as a string.
