Cap 19: Functional Programming Tools
pag 574

By most definitions, today’s Python blends support for multiple programming para-
digms: procedural (with its basic statements), object-oriented (with its classes), and
functional. For the latter of these, Python includes a set of built-ins used for functional
programming—tools that apply functions to sequences and other iterables.

Python includes a set of built-ins used for functional
programming—tools that apply functions to sequences and other iterables. This set
includes tools that call functions on an iterable’s items ( map ); filter out items based on
a test function ( filter ); and apply functions to pairs of items and running results
( reduce ).
